### Bizbox preinstall

Edit accounts.yml file to specify user and password

```
cd /srv/git/bizbox
vi accounts.yml
```

```
sb install preinstall
```

This step will create the user account specified in accounts.yml, add it to sudoers, update the kernel, edit GRUB configuration, install Rclone, and reboot the server if needed.

If your server did not need to reboot you can run su username to switch user or reconnect to SSH as the newly created user. Everything after this point will assume you are running as the user entered in accounts.yml
